"Here it is..."

Vilvan pulls out a hologram chip from a dustly metal drawer in
your father's desk. He places the chip on the desk and presses
the center, activating the chip. Soon the figure of a familiar
man appears above the electronic piece.

"Hello... Silvester."

The man you know as your father adresses you from the hologram.

"If you are seeing this, that means that it's been 18 years
since I left Emphaslia. I know you must have a lot of questions.
It's probably hard to understand why I left you and your mother,
but that is why I've asked Vilvan to give you this on your 20th
birthday."

You glance at Vilvan for a second before turning your gaze back
on the image of your father.

"By the time you're watching this, I'll be long gone. However,
If you are still interested in knowing about me after all these
years, I have left you a little gift. I'll let you decide what
to do and where to go."

You turn to Vilvan.

"Your father instructed me to give you this after you watched the
holovid."

Vilvan pulls a keycard out of his pocket. 

"This is the key to your father's old spacecraft. As he mentioned,
you are free to do whatever you like with it."
