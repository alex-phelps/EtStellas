"Here it is..."

Vilvan pulls out a hologram chip from a dustly metal drawer in your father's desk.
He places the chip on the desk and presses the center, activating the chip.
Soon the figure of a familiar man appears above the electronic piece.

"Hello... Silvester."

The man you know as your father adresses you from the hologram.

"If you are seeing this, that means that it's been 18 years since I left Emphaslia.
I know you must have a lot of questions. I understand that it it probably hard to
understand why I left you and your mother, but that is why I've asked Vilvan to
give you this on your 20th birthday."
